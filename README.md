## Contribute

Edith welcomes contributions! This section lists some examples of how you can help. If you want to help in other ways than the ones listed below, [let me know](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new)!

- **Bugs**: Nobody likes bugs. If you find one, please [report it](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new). Tell me what happened, and what you expected to happen. Try to be as specific as you can.
- **Feature requests**: If you think something's missing, submit a [feature request](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new) and tell me what you'd like to see.

### User experience (UX)

Edith should be accessible to learners from different walks of life, cultures, and experiences. If you have experience in UX, web accessibility, or if just you feel something is hard to use, [let me know](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new).

### Documentation

Due to Edith still being in heavy development at this time, it's likely that any documentation will become outdated.

However, Edith needs sample content for demo purposes, to help people understand how _their_ experience would look like. If you'd like to write sample tutorials, or donate existing ones, let me know by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new).

### Code

If you know your way around code, I'd love your help working on feature and bug fixes.

Edith is based on [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

Don't have experience in those technologies? Neither did I when I started this project. **We'll learn together**. If you have experience in Javascript, that's helpful.

## Mentorship

If you're excited about the idea of a open learning platform, but you don't yet feel you have the skills to contribute, I'd like to help you get there.

If you have any questions, either [submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new), or reach out to me through the channels listed on the bottom of [my web site](https://marcus.se.net).
