**Important**: Edith is still in early development and is not production-ready. **Use at your own risk**.

## Contribute

Edith welcomes contributions! This section lists some examples of how you can help. If you want to help in other ways than the ones listed below, let me know by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new)!

### Submit issues

- **Bugs**: Nobody likes bugs. If you find one, please [report it](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new). Tell me what happened, and what you expected to happen. Try to be as specific as you can. 
- **Feature requests**: If you think something's missing, submit a [feature request](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new) and tell me what you'd like to see.

### User experience (UX)

Edith should be accessible to learners from different walks of life, cultures, and experiences. If you have experience in UX, web accessibility, or if just you feel something is hard to use, let me know by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith/issues/new)

### Write code

If you know your way around code, I'd love your help working on feature and bug fixes. 

Edith is based on [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). 

Don't have experience in those technologies? Neither did I when I started this project. **We'll learn together**. If you have experience in Javascript, that's helpful.

To get started writing code:

1. **Get the code**.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/marcusolsson/edith.git
   ```

1. **Start the site in develop mode**.

   ```
   cd edith
   yarn develop
   ```
   
1. **Navigate to http://localhost:8000**.
